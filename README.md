## Usage

### Rolling Dice

#### Basic Rolls
Roll dice using standard RPG notation:
- `/rolld 3d6` - Roll 3 six-sided dice
- `4d10` - Also works by simply typing in chat
- `/rolld 2d20` - Roll 2 twenty-sided dice
- `/rolld 1d100` - Roll 1 d100/percentile die

#### With Modifiers
Add bonuses or penalties to your rolls:
- `/rolld 1d20+5` - Roll 1d20 and add 5 to the result
- `2d8-3` - Roll 2d8 and subtract 3 from the result
- `/rolld 3d6+2` - Roll 3d6 and add 2 to the final result

#### Advantage and Disadvantage
Roll with advantage (best of two) or disadvantage (worst of two):
- `/rolld 1d20adv` - Roll 1d20 with advantage (roll twice, take the higher result)
- `2d20dis` - Roll 2d20 with disadvantage (roll twice for each die, take the lower result)
- `/rolld 1d20adv+4` - Combine advantage with modifiers

#### Success Counting
Count how many dice meet or exceed a difficulty class (DC):
- `/rolld 5d10cd6` - Roll 5d10 and count how many results are ‚â• 6
- `7d8cd4` - Roll 7d8 and count how many results are ‚â• 4
- `/rolld 10d6cd5` - Perfect for systems like World of Darkness

### Bot Commands

- `/rolld [dice]` - Roll dice using the specified notation
- `/stats` - Show bot statistics (number of servers and total rolls)
- `/ajuda` or `/help` - Display help information in Portuguese or English

## How It Works

The bot uses regular expressions to parse dice notation and process different types of rolls:

1. **Parsing**: The `parse_dice_notation()` function identifies the number of dice, dice sides, advantage/disadvantage, modifiers, and success counting parameters.

2. **Rolling**: The `roll_dice()` function generates random numbers based on the parsed parameters and calculates the final results.

3. **Formatting**: The `format_roll_result()` function creates a readable message showing the individual dice results and the final outcome.

4. **Statistics**: The bot tracks the total number of rolls made and displays this in its status message, which updates every 5 minutes.

## Limitations

- Maximum of 100 dice per roll
- Maximum of 1000 sides per die
- The bot does not support complex dice expressions like "2d6+1d8"
